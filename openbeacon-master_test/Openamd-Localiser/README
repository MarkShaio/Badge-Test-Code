This is The Next HOPE's OpenAMD packet framer and position estimation tool.
Roughly, the code breaks down as follows:

dispatch : the OpenAMD framing, decryption, and callback logic

	network_rx		: Process OpenAMD packets from a UDP port listener
	normalized_rxtx : Process or produce OpenAMD packets in a "normalized" form

		sputnik_to_norm.pl : Mangle Sputnik logs into normalized form

	pcap_rx			: Process OpenAMD packets from a PCAP log file

util	: Misc utility functions that didn't fit elsewhere

spaceparttree : A 3D spacial partitioning tree.

	spaceparttree_test : A simple test program.

openbeacon : specific OpenAMD OpenBeacon position estimation code

	readerloc : parse a database of receiver positions

estimator.c	: The main program that glues it all together for TNH
